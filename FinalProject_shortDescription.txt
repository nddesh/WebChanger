This project is an online style editor tool which can edit external websites on the page by changing fonts, colors, decoration, etc. The idea behind this project was to create a fun, interactive tool that allows people to see changes to a website in real-time and play around with HTML/webpage styling without prior knowledge of HTML/CSS or JavaScript.
